NextStep is a mobile RPG built in Unity where a player’s real-world steps power
their hero’s journey with data collected from HealthKit (iOS) and Health Connect
(Android). Each step converts to in-game XP, resources, and quest progress. The
primary goal of creating this app is to promote healthier lifestyles by encouraging
consistent daily physical activity, while keeping the player engaged through gamified
progression. By blending fitness tracking with RPG mechanics, movement becomes a
rewarding adventure, and players are encouraged to stay active to continue their epic
adventure.

The core gameplay elements affected by physical activity will be completing
Quests, increasing Player Stats (Strength, Stamina, Speed), and earning
Loot/Equipment. Players will take on fitness-based quests such as "Walk 5,000 steps to
defeat the Slime King" or "Complete a 30-minute workout to rescue the town from a
siege.” Steps will be directly translated to character experience points (XP). There will
be large XP bonuses for reaching certain milestones to provide a feeling of a “big win.”
New armor or consumables will be unlocked when the user reaches specific step
targets. The in-game character will be a 2D sprite that the player can customize, and
will evolve based on character progression
